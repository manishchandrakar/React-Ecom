## Getting Started

To run this project locally, you can use the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes, and you may see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more information on running tests, check the [running tests documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It optimizes the build for the best performance, including minification. Your app will be ready for deployment. For more details, refer to the [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

If you're not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This will copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control over them. However, you don't have to use `eject` unless you're ready for advanced customization.
